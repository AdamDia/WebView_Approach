# WebView_Approach

WebView Approach is an innovative iOS application designed to demonstrate robust software development practices in a real-world scenario. The app showcases the integration and manipulation of web content within a native iOS environment, utilizing a WebView to display and interact with HTML content.

This project serves as a practical example of various key concepts in iOS development, including network communication, file handling, asynchronous programming, and architectural patterns such as MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel). It also exemplifies the implementation of unit testing to ensure the reliability and maintainability of the codebase.
## Demo




## Key Features

- Efficient File Management: The app intelligently manages file downloads. It ensures that zip files are downloaded only once throughout the application's lifetime, avoiding unnecessary network calls and enhancing performance.

- Dynamic Web Content Interaction: At its core, the app showcases dynamic interactions with web content. It adeptly loads index.html and enables real-time changes to the web view. This includes:

    - Button Functionality: The functionality of the 'Click Me!' button within the web view is carefully handled to enable dynamic image replacement within the web content.
    - Image Replacement: The app allows for changing the images displayed in the web content. It demonstrates replacing the second image (the_other_image.jpeg) with a chosen image, showcasing the app's ability to manipulate web view elements on the fly.
    - Behavioural Adaptation: A unique feature of the app is its ability to change the behavior of the 'Click Me!' button. Instead of altering the bottom image in the web view, the app can be configured to replace the top image, demonstrating flexibility and dynamic content control within the web environment.
## Technologies Used

- Swift: The primary programming language for iOS app development.
- RxSwift: A framework for reactive programming in Swift.
- WebKit: A powerful web content engine integrated into the app for rendering HTML content.
- XCTest: Apple's framework used for unit and UI testing in Xcode.
- Mocking: Custom mock classes and protocols to simulate and test app behavior.
